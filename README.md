# 🎄 Unqualified Opinions™  
### An emotionally irresponsible AI that judges you for no reason

> **Tagline:**  
> *An app that looks at your face and gives opinions it is absolutely not qualified to have.*

---

## ✨ What Is This?

**Unqualified Opinions™** is a playful, useless, and proudly unhelpful web app built for **Code At Christmas**.

It uses your webcam to *guess* your mood — badly — and responds with **sarcastic, sassy, and emotionally unnecessary opinions**.

It does not heal you.  
It does not guide you.  
It just… comments.

And that’s the whole point.

---

## 🎄 Why This Exists

Almost every app today wants to:
- Fix us  
- Improve us  
- Heal us  

So we asked an important question:

> **What if an app did the opposite?**

What if AI stopped being supportive…  
and started being *unqualified*?

This project is a parody of:
- Mental health apps  
- Productivity apps  
- Overly serious AI tools  

Built purely for **joy, chaos, and vibes**.

## 🧠 How It Works (Emotionally Unnecessary Edition)

1. You open the app  
2. You give webcam permission (legally, but rudely)  
3. The app looks at your face  
4. It guesses your mood (confidence > accuracy)  
5. It gives you an opinion you did not ask for  

That’s it.  
There is no growth arc.

## 🎭 Features That Make It Fun (and Weird)

### 😌 Mood Detection (Kind Of)
- Detects a single face from the webcam
- Infers one dominant mood:
  - Happy
  - Sad
  - Neutral
  - Confused
- Accuracy is **not** the goal  
- Misjudgment is part of the personality

---

### 💬 Unqualified Opinions Engine
- AI-generated sarcastic responses
- Tone changes based on detected mood:
  - **Happy:** dismissive, jealous, mocking  
  - **Sad:** dry, deadpan, unimpressed  
  - **Neutral:** bored, disappointed  
- Always playful  
- Never empathetic  
- Never helpful  

---

### 📈 Progressive Meanness
- The more you ask for opinions…
- The more confident (and meaner) the app becomes
- It remembers you *within the session*
- Growth, but make it worse

---

### 🤯 Gaslighting Mode
- Sometimes the app contradicts itself
- Sometimes it changes its mind
- No explanations
- Confusion is a feature

---

### 🌪️ Chaos Mode
- Ignores mood detection completely
- Delivers random, unhinged opinions
- Reality optional

---

### 🧠 Meta & Self-Aware Humor
The app sometimes:
- Roasts itself  
- Mentions being built in a hackathon  
- Questions why it exists  

It knows it’s useless.  
It’s at peace with that.

## 🎨 UI & Design Philosophy

**Cute UI. Mean text.**

- Fully responsive (works on desktop, tablet, and mobile)
- Cozy, Christmas-themed visuals:
  - Hanging lights
  - Festive decorations
  - Soft pastel colors
- Rounded cards & friendly fonts
- Gentle animations & micro-interactions
- Festive warmth + emotional damage

The contrast is intentional.

---

## 📱 Responsive by Design

Unqualified Opinions™ works seamlessly across devices:
- Desktop 💻
- Tablet 📱
- Mobile 📲

No matter the screen size —  
the judgment adapts.

---

## 🧑‍⚖️ Consent & Safety

- Clear, humorous consent screen
- No appearance insults
- No self-harm references
- No hate or slurs

This app is:
> **Playfully demeaning, not harmful**

Please do not take life advice from it.  
It absolutely should not be trusted.

---

## 🎄 Built For Code At Christmas

This project celebrates:
- Weird ideas  
- Useless creativity  
- Building without pressure  
- Coding purely for fun  

Because sometimes, code doesn’t need to be impactful.

Sometimes it just needs to exist.

---

## 🏁 Final Words

**Unqualified Opinions™** is:
- Weird  
- Useless  
- Emotionally unavailable  

And proud of it.

Thanks for being judged 🎄✨
